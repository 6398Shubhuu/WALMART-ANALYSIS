Introduction
In this article, we will analyze Walmart sales data using Python. We will explore the provided code and understand how it can be used to visualize and analyze the sales data.

Key Concepts
Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library in Python used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle and analyze structured data.

Numpy: Numpy is a fundamental package in Python used for scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library in Python that provides a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It is widely used for creating charts, plots, histograms, and other visual representations of data.

Seaborn: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Datetime: Datetime is a module in Python that provides classes for manipulating dates and times. It allows us to perform various operations on dates, such as extracting the week number and year from a given date.
